======

hook objc_msgSend to trace Objective-C method callz

based on the work of Stefan Esser on his dumpdecrypted.dylib stuff 
and libsubjc from kennytm that i couldn't build from source nor use properly (maybe my bad dude)
all credz to them srsly, they've done teh work. i've just added some bullshit.

usage(until fronted functionnal): 
root# DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES=itrace.dylib /Applications/Calculator.app/Calculator
oh and be sure to have itrace.plist in the current directory
this dylib just hook objc_msgSend thanks to MobileSubstrate/interpos (just uncomment some 
commented line to switch method) & print out the class and methods called, white/blacklisting

last rev: 2013/02/17
work done on free time (when not drinking) and @ Sogeti ESEC, thanks to them for the research time o/
